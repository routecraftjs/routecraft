## RC1001
Route definition failed validation

**Why it happens**  
The route is missing required fields, most commonly a source.

**Suggestion**  
Ensure a source is defined: start with `from(adapter)` and then add steps.

**Example**
```ts
craft().id('my-route').from(timer())
```

## RC1002
Duplicate route id

**Why it happens**  
Two or more routes share the same id.

**Suggestion**  
Ensure each route id is unique or set `routeOptions.id`.

**Example**
```ts
craft().from(timer()).id('users');
craft().from(timer()).id('orders');
```

## RC2001
Invalid operation type

**Why it happens**  
The step received unsupported input.

**Suggestion**  
Use a supported operator and verify the step name.

**Example**
```ts
// split requires an array
craft().from(simple(['a','b'])).split()
```

## RC2002
Missing from step

**Why it happens**  
Steps were added before defining a source.

**Suggestion**  
Start the route with `from` and a valid source adapter.

**Example**
```ts
craft().from(timer()).transform(x => x)
```

## RC3001
Route failed to start

**Why it happens**  
The route's abort controller was already aborted or an adapter could not initialize.

**Suggestion**  
Ensure the route isn't aborted before `start()`. Verify adapter configuration.

**Example**
```ts
const ctx = context().routes(myRoute).build();
await ctx.start();
```

## RC3002
Context failed to start

**Why it happens**  
Invalid configuration, duplicate ids, or missing sources.

**Suggestion**  
Validate plugin exports and global configuration.

**Example**
```ts
context().routes(validRoutes).build().start()
```

## RC5001
Source adapter threw

**Why it happens**  
Source failed during subscription or production.

**Suggestion**  
Verify connectivity and adapter options.

## RC5002
Processing step threw

**Why it happens**  
Processor logic threw or rejected.

**Suggestion**  
Add guards to transforms and processors.

## RC5003
Destination adapter threw

**Why it happens**  
Destination failed to send data.

**Suggestion**  
Verify destination connectivity and options.

## RC5004
Split operation failed

**Why it happens**  
Split function threw or input was not iterable.

**Suggestion**  
Ensure the input is iterable and guarded.

## RC5005
Aggregation operation failed

**Why it happens**  
Aggregation logic threw or shapes mismatched.

**Suggestion**  
Validate partial shapes and defaults.

## RC5006
Transform function threw

**Why it happens**  
Transform logic threw or accessed missing properties.

**Suggestion**  
Narrow input types and add guards.

## RC5007
Tap step threw

**Why it happens**  
Side-effect function threw.

**Suggestion**  
Keep tap side effects resilient.

## RC5008
Filter predicate threw

**Why it happens**  
Predicate accessed missing fields or threw.

**Suggestion**  
Guard against missing properties and unexpected shapes.

## RC5009
Validation failed

**Why it happens**  
Schema failed or validator threw.

**Suggestion**  
Adjust the schema or coerce input.

## RC9901
Unknown error

**Why it happens**  
Unexpected failure without a specific code.

**Suggestion**  
Check logs and enable debug level.
