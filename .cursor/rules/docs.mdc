## Documentation guidance

- Prefer source files under `packages/routecraft/src/*` and `packages/cli/src/*` as truth.
- When editing docs, cross-check examples with `examples/*` and tests.
- Link to specific files using `@` references where helpful.

Key pages to keep updated:

@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/introduction/installation/page.md
@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/introduction/project-structure/page.md
@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/introduction/routes/page.md
@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/reference/operations/page.md
@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/reference/cli/page.md
@apps/routecraft.dev/src/app/docs/reference/adapters/page.md
