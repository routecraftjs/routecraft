Adapter role model: `Source` / `Destination` / `Enricher`, and the DSL option laws (#532).

Mid-route reads were modeled as "a Destination whose `send` returns the content", which overloaded one slot with two contracts (push-out void vs pull-in value) and forced adapter factories to infer their category from option VALUES (`mode: 'read'`, path-string sniffing, category-by-absence). That inference is structurally unsound through overloads, so the slot is split instead: `Destination.send` is now strictly void (push OUT; the body flows through unchanged) and the new `Enricher.fetch` pulls a value IN. The operation keyword selects the role: `.from()` subscribes, `.to()`/`.tap()` prefer `send` and fall back to `fetch` (a fetch result replaces the body in `.to()`; `.tap()` always discards), `.enrich()` fetches.

Breaking changes:

- `.enrich(x)` with the aggregator omitted now REPLACES the body with the fetched value (it previously spread-merged). `only()` and `none()` remain for merging; the `replace()` helper is deleted (it is the default now). Custom aggregator functions are unchanged, but the aggregator type is renamed `DestinationAggregator` to `EnrichAggregator`. A fetch resolving `undefined` means "no value" and leaves the body unchanged; the bare-enrich / fetch-only-`.to()` overloads reflect this via the new `FetchedBody` helper type (a result type including `undefined` infers the union of the previous body and the defined results).
- File-family adapters (`file`, `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`, `xml`, `html`) drop the `mode` option. Position selects the role; send behavior uses `append: true` / `delete: true` (mutually exclusive, RC5003 at construction). `jsonl`'s send now overwrites by default (`append: true` restores the old default; audit every `.to(jsonl(...))` event log). Note the same silent flip for `.tap()`: a migrated `.tap(json({ path }))` resolves to `send` and writes, where the old `mode: 'read'` tap read and discarded; use `.enrich()` to read. The per-mode aliases (`FileReadAdapter`, `CsvReadAdapter`, `JsonReadAdapter`, `JsonlReadAdapter`, `XmlReadAdapter`, `HtmlReadAdapter`) are deleted.
- `json()`'s transformer extraction option is renamed `path` to `pointer`; `path` now always means a file path and its presence alone selects the file roles (no more slash-sniffing).
- Sends that produce receipts surface them via headers instead of body replacement: `.to(mail())` sets `routecraft.mail.sentMessageId` / `.accepted` / `.rejected` / `.response` (the `MailSendResult` type is deleted; the inbound `routecraft.mail.messageId` set by the source is left untouched so mail-to-mail routes keep their correlation id); carddav writes/deletes set the `routecraft.carddav.url` / `.uid` / `.etag` keys the read side already uses, plus `.created` for insert-vs-update (`CarddavWriteResult` / `CarddavDeleteResult` are deleted). Adapters set receipts through the new `SendContext.setHeader` sink on `send`; observability hooks split per slot (`getMetadata(result)` for fetch, `getSendMetadata(receipts)` for send).
- Pull-in adapters are now typed `Enricher` and their classes renamed accordingly: `HttpEnricherAdapter`, `MailEnricherAdapter`, `DirectEnricherAdapter`, `LlmEnricherAdapter`, `AgentEnricherAdapter`, `EmbeddingEnricherAdapter`, `McpEnricherAdapter`, `AgentBrowserEnricherAdapter`. Route-level behavior of `.to(http({ url }))`, `.to(direct("x"))`, `.to(llm(...))` is unchanged.
- `chunked: true` requires the literal `true` (a widened boolean is a compile error), and the chunked variant keeps the send/fetch roles.
- `ToResultBody` is deleted; `CallableDestination<T>` is void-only; `CallableEnricher<T, R>`, `Enricher<T, R>`, `SendContext`, and `ToTarget` are new exports.
- `@routecraft/testing`: `spy()` grows a `fetch` face (records into `calls.enrich` and returns the current body); a `mockAdapter` `send` handler's return value now follows the step's slot resolution (used by fetch-resolved steps, discarded by send-resolved `.to()`).
